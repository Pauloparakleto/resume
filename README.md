# RESUME
Here is for those who have gotten in touch from countries around the world

As the level you're looking for is a little bit more high than the Brazilian Market, I invite you to take a look on my personal project where I improve all my skills considering the Ruby Best Practices.
If you are a Tech Lead, you might check my semantic commits, the CI/CD configuration, the Rspec tests and the automatic API documentation using `gem rswagger`.

[Personal Project](https://github.com/Pauloparakleto/hiring)

I'll give to you more attention adding more explanation in English, I promisse :)
