# RESUME
Here is for those who have gotten in touch from countries around the world

Experience: I'm a Junior Backend Ruby on Rails in the Fintech Market in Brazil since march 2021.

I'm also a master degree in Economy and I worked as a Manager in a Start Up for eight months (2017-2018) coming up with issues to the web developers team. It was exactly the flame I needed to initialize myself on the Ruby on Rails Way.

As the level you're looking for is a little bit more high than the Brazilian Market, I invite you to take a look on my personal project where I improve all my skills considering the Ruby Best Practices.
If you are a Tech Leader, you might check my semantic commits, the CI/CD configuration, the Rspec tests and the automatic API documentation using `gem rswagger`.

I'll give to you more attention adding more explanation in English, I promisse :)
